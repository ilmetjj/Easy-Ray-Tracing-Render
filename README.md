# Easy-Ray-Tracing-Render

## A c++ based ray-tracing render program

The aim of this project is to creat a program able to render a scene with 3D objects using a ray tracing algorithm.

## How to use

At the moment you can edit the `main.cpp` file to create new entitys as objects of the respective classes and add theme to the scene. You can also edit the movement function passed to the scene to change the movement pattern at each iteration.

At the moment are available a real time terminal render and a PNG render. You can render a sequence of images and edit theme as frames into a video (es. using Blender).
